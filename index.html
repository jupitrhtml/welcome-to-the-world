        <h2>This, is earth!</h2>
        Yeah I know, looks pretty strange, doesnt it? Like somebody splattered paint <br>
        over a giant marble. But you, <em>(yes you)</em> are on this planet right now!
        
        <p>Daunting, but very cool. Welcome to the world!</p>
        <h2>Who are <em>you</em>?</h2>

            You are a person, in a body. Alot of things are going on right now <br>
            in your body! You are not just a hollow base, you know? You are full of surprises! <br><br>
            Perhaps you are scared right now, or are confused. Dont worry,<br>
            <em>Everything is going to be fine.</em> You are going to live for a long time.<br><br>

        <h2>Are <em>you</em> a human?</h2>
        <p>My best guess, you probably are. But if you are a animal, that is getting <br>
        read to, then you are still welcome on our humble planet!</p>
        
        <h2>What makes you special</h2>
        <p>
            Everybody is special, in their own way! So, what does make <em>you</em> special? <br>
            <h3>1. Your eyes</h3> What is <em>your</em> eye color? If its blue, hazel, or any other color, thats really special!
            <h3>2. Your hands</h3> If you look down, you might see your hands! They are really special, <br>
            because you can touch and feel alot of things!
            <h3>3. Your hair</h3> What does your hair look like? Is it black, blonde, or even, <em>blue</em>,<br>
            that is really special! Your hair protects your head from things, and is very useful!
            <h3>4. <em>You</em></h3> You are special in your own way. Everybody is, and <em>you</em> are amazing.<br>
            <em>You</em> are strong. <br>
            <em>You</em> are brave. <br>
            <em>You</em> are here. <br>
            <h2>You, are loved by everyone.</h2>
        <br>

        <h2>For <em>everyone</em></h2>
